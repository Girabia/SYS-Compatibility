# Rules to be followed
These rules must be followed when posting issues.
- I agree that I beat the game before posting an issue about how it works
- Do not say that a game is running poorly or dropping the framerate when a game shader is built and loaded as this is not considered that the game is running poorly
- Specify correctly whether a game is running correctly because if someone else comments that the game is running completely different from yours and the computer configurations are the same, your analysis will be analyzed and the appropriate measures will be taken
- Posts must always contain the requested data, with the tag correctly filled in within the issue
- Preferably write them in English for general understanding
- In the title, put the name of the game and then in parentheses the game ID that the emulator mentions
- Before posting a game, check if the game you want to post already has an issue
- Use the recommended software across the server as it is what we have identified with the best compatibility
- Do not indicate that the game is running poorly if your computer's settings are not sufficient for the software to run correctly

# Penalties that will be applied
If the rules above have not been applied correctly, we will check the case to see if the punishments that will include a strike system are applied.
- 1st Strike: You will have less priority when posting an issue where it will be analyzed before leaving it for a while, this penalty will remain for a week, but the strike will be marked as taken, this strike will come out after a month from the first post
- 2nd Strike: If you have taken the second strike at the same time as the first, your issue will be ignored for up to one month longer, this strike will come out after two months
- 3rd Strike: If you took the third strike at the time of having the second strike, your issue will be permanently ignored and removed, the only way to reverse this will be to speak to one of the moderators and even talking to them it will be analyzed by the team whether the strike will be removed or not

# How to use tags (they are mandatory)
You must put two tags in your issue, one for how the game is running and one for the engine used.
## Tags for game:
- ![#40DE32](https://placehold.co/15x15/40DE32/40DE32.png) **Perfect**: This demarcation means that the game is running perfectly without bugs and fps drops
- ![#8DA01E](https://placehold.co/15x15/8DA01E/8DA01E.png) **Great**: It's running well, but there are a few bugs that occasionally occur
- ![#6C720F](https://placehold.co/15x15/6C720F/6C720Fpng) **Ok**: It's running but it's constantly having bugs
- ![#CA881B](https://placehold.co/15x15/CA881B/CA881B.png) **Bad**: It is running with possible framerate drops or bugs
- ![#701616](https://placehold.co/15x15/701616/701616.png) **Intro/Menu**: Can't get past the menu
- ![#F60A21](https://placehold.co/15x15/F60A21/F60A21.png) **Won't Boot**: Not started by the system
## Tags for Engine:
- ![#7C0D60](https://placehold.co/15x15/7C0D60/7C0D60.png) **Vulkan**: This means you used the Vulkan API to play the game
- ![#218465](https://placehold.co/15x15/218465/218465.png) **OpenGL**: This means you used the OpenGL API to play the game
